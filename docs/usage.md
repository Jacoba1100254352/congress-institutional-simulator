# Congress Institutional Simulator Usage

This document is the project-facing guide for running and extending the simulator.

## Requirements

- Java 21 or newer
- `make`

The project has no external Java dependencies.

## Common Commands

Build the simulator:

```sh
make build
```

Run the default scenario comparison:

```sh
make run
```

Run tests:

```sh
make test
```

The same test command runs in GitHub Actions on pushes and pull requests.

Run the current campaign report:

```sh
make campaign
```

Run the earlier v0 campaign:

```sh
make campaign-v0
```

Run the v1 proposal-cost/flooding campaign:

```sh
make campaign-v1
```

Run the v2 challenge-voucher campaign:

```sh
make campaign-v2

## Research Documentation

- [Calibration and validation](calibration.md): tracked benchmark extract, external validation targets, and the executable calibration workflow.
- [ODD model description](odd-model.md): entities, state variables, scheduling, design concepts, initialization, and submodels.
- [Full ODD+D appendix](odd-d-appendix.md): submission-ready model documentation covering data, adaptation, submodels, assumptions, and outputs.

## CLI Examples

```

Compare selected scenarios:

```sh
make run ARGS="--scenarios simple-majority,default-pass,default-pass-informed-guarded"
```

Write machine-readable output:

```sh
make run ARGS="--format csv"
```

Show ASCII bars:

```sh
make run ARGS="--charts"
```

Run a campaign with custom settings:

```sh
make campaign ARGS="--runs 300 --legislators 151 --bills 100 --seed 12345"
```

## Metrics

The simulator reports several metrics because passage volume alone is not enough to evaluate an institution.

Direction markers are used in generated reports and paper figures:

- `↑`: higher is generally better.
- `↓`: lower is generally better.
- `diag.`: context-dependent activity or risk context.

The campaign CSV also includes `directionalScore`, `representativeQuality`, and `riskControl`. These are display scores, not proof that a system is best. `directionalScore` averages productivity, representative quality, and risk control. `representativeQuality` combines welfare, enacted support, compromise, public alignment, and legitimacy. `riskControl` inverts low-support passage, minority harm, lobby capture, public-preference distortion, concentrated-harm passage, proposer gain, and policy shift.

- `productivity` `↑`: share of potential bills enacted.
- `caseWeight` `diag.`: likelihood weight used by sensitivity campaigns; ordinary campaigns use `1.0`.
- `floor` `diag.`: share of potential bills reaching floor consideration.
- `avgSupport` `↑`: average yes-vote share for enacted bills.
- `welfare` `↑`: average public-benefit score for enacted bills.
- `cooperation` `↑`: productivity weighted by enacted support.
- `compromise` `↑`: moderation, support, and distance from proposer advantage.
- `gridlock` `↓`: share of potential bills not enacted.
- `accessD` `diag.`: share of potential bills denied by proposal-access rules.
- `cmteRej` `diag.`: share of potential bills rejected by committee.
- `challengeRate` `diag.`: share of potential bills diverted from default enactment into active voting by challenge vouchers or q-member escalation.
- `lowSupport` `↓`: enacted bills with less than 50 percent yes support.
- `popularFail` `↓`: high-public-support bills that fail.
- `policyShift` `diag.`: average movement away from the prior status quo; this can be reform or volatility depending on the scenario.
- `propGain` `↓`: enacted movement toward the proposer's ideal point.
- `lobbyCapture` `↓`: average enacted-bill capture risk from positive lobby pressure, private gain, and weak public value.
- `publicAlignment` `↑`: how closely enacted voting support tracks generated public support.
- `antiLobbyingSuccess` `↑`: share of generated anti-lobbying reform bills enacted.
- `privateGainRatio` `↓`: enacted private gain relative to generated public benefit.
- `lobbySpendPerBill` `diag.`: explicit lobby-group spend per potential bill.
- `defensiveLobbyingShare` `diag.`: share of lobby spend aimed at defeating anti-lobbying reform bills.
- `captureReturnOnSpend` `↓`: enacted capture risk per unit of explicit lobby spend.
- `publicPreferenceDistortion` `↓`: average gap between enacted yes-share and generated public support.
- `amendmentRate` `diag.`: share of potential bills whose policy position moved during mediation.
- `amendmentMovement` `diag.`: average absolute policy movement created by mediation per potential bill.
- `minorityHarm` `↓`: average enacted concentrated harm weighted by affected-group opposition.
- `concentratedHarmPassage` `↓`: share of high concentrated-harm bills that are enacted.
- `compensationRate` `diag.`: share of potential bills receiving compensation amendments.
- `legitimacy` `↑`: enacted-bill legitimacy proxy combining public support, chamber support, affected-group support, and harm penalties.
- `activeLawWelfare` `↑`: average generated public benefit among active laws at delayed review points.
- `reversalRate` `diag.`: share of delayed law reviews that repeal a provisional law.
- `timeToCorrectBadLaw` `↓`: average rounds between enactment and repeal for corrected laws.
- `lowSupportActiveLawShare` `↓`: share of active laws at review points with public support below 50 percent.
- `selectedAlternativeMedianDistance` `↓`: average distance between selected alternatives and the chamber median.
- `proposerAgendaAdvantage` `↓`: average selected-alternative movement toward the original proposer's ideal point.
- `alternativeDiversity` `diag.`: average number of alternatives/status quo options considered per tournament.
- `statusQuoWinRate` `diag.`: share of policy tournaments where the status quo blocks final ratification.
- `publicBenefitPerLobbyDollar` `↑`: enacted public benefit per unit of explicit lobby spend.
- `directLobbySpendShare`, `agendaLobbySpendShare`, `informationLobbySpendShare`, `publicCampaignSpendShare`, `litigationThreatSpendShare` `diag.`: explicit lobbying spend allocation by channel.
- `citizenReviewRate` `diag.`: share of potential bills reviewed by a synthetic citizen panel.

- `crossBlocAdmissionRate`, `affectedGroupSponsorshipRate`, `averageCosponsors` `diag.`: richer cosponsorship diagnostics.
- `proposalBondForfeiture` `diag.`: average proposal-bond loss per potential bill.
- `strategicDecoyRate` `↓`: strategic clone/decoy alternatives introduced per tournament.
- `proposerAccessGini` `↓`: concentration of floor access across proposers.

- `vetoes`: presidential veto count.
- `overrides`: veto override count.

Campaign CSV files also include absolute load metrics such as `enactedPerRun` and `floorPerRun`.

## Extending The Simulator

The main extension points are small interfaces:

- `VotingStrategy`: converts legislator incentives into `YAY` or `NAY`.
- `VoteInfluence`: models one source of voting pressure.
- `VotingRule`: converts vote totals into passage or failure.
- `ProposalAccessRule`: controls whether a bill reaches floor consideration.
- `LegislativeProcess`: wraps one or more institutional stages around a bill.
- `Scenario`: names and builds an institutional design for comparison.

Typical additions:

- Add a new voting pressure in `src/main/java/congresssim/behavior`.
- Add a new agenda screen in `src/main/java/congresssim/institution`.
- Add a new process wrapper in `src/main/java/congresssim/institution`.
- For anti-capture modeling, use `LobbyTransparencyProcess`, `LobbyAuditProcess`, or `PublicInterestScreenAccessRule`.
- For explicit lobbying actors, add `LobbyGroup` instances to `SimulationWorld` and wrap a process with `BudgetedLobbyingProcess`.
- Register the new scenario in `src/main/java/congresssim/simulation/ScenarioCatalog.java`.
- Add focused coverage in `src/test/java/congresssim/SimulatorTests.java`.

After changing behavior, run:

```sh
make test
make campaign
```
